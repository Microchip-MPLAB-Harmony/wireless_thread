# Application Configuration

**Release details**

In this release, there are 4 hex<br /> files and 2 projects included

The hex files are named as follows:

1.  demo\_app\_udp\_ftd\_leader.hex
2.  demo\_app\_udp\_ftd\_router.hex
3.  demo\_app\_udp\_mtd\_med.hex
4.  demo\_app\_udp\_mtd\_sed.hex

It is recommended to first flash the demo\_app\_udp\_ftd\_leader.hex file and then<br /> flash the remaining hex files to their respective nodes.

Additionally, there<br /> are 2 projects bundled with this release:

1.  demo\_app\_udp\_ftd
2.  demo\_app\_udp\_mtd

Once the hex files have been flashed as per the release details, the nodes will<br /> automatically form a network and begin transmitting data.

**To configure FTD as a leader**

Please open the demo\_app\_udp\_ftd.x file using MPLAB X IDE and navigate to the<br /> thread\_demo.h file as directed.
