# Thread MCC Component Overview

Thread SDK MCC Component is based on single component with Device Role selection and based on the<br /> device role, the configuration options will be populated. The Thread Stack Component in<br /> MPLAB Code Configurator has certain dependencies and capabilities. Some dependencies are<br /> mandatory, while others are only necessary when certain functional features are<br /> included. The table below provides details on these dependencies and their<br /> requirements.

<br />

|Dependency Component|Dependency Type|Description|
|--------------------|---------------|-----------|
|IEEE 802.15.4 PHY|Mandatory|Phy lib is mandatory requirement for using the IEEE 802.15.4<br /> based radio services.|
|RTOS|Mandatory|Thread uses RTOS service as per functional design.|
|Core|Mandatory|Thread uses Core service as per functional design.|
|PDS\_SubSystem|Mandatory|Thread uses Persistent Data Server for Data backup.|
|SYS\_TIME|Mandatory|Phy lib Uses SYS\_TIME for internal Timer Purposes.|
|LIB\_WOLFCRYPT|Mandatory|Thread uses crypto services from LIB\_WOLFCRYPT.|
|Thread USART|Optional|Thread USART is not a mandatory service and required when a<br /> serial Parser \(CLI\) or RCP or a Logger\(if CLI is enabled\) is<br /> enabled.|
|Thread Log|Optional|Thread Log is not a mandatory service and required when Thread<br /> Log is enabled when Serial Parser\(CLI\) is not enabled.|

<br />

Thread has a Capability of its own which can be used by other components whenever Thread<br /> Stack Service is necessary.

<br />

**Note:** By default **Thread USART** and **Thread Log** dependencies are disabled and will be enabled based on the feature selected.
