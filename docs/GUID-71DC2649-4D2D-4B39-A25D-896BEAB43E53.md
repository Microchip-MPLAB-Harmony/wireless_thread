# CLI MCC Configuration

The Thread CLI MCC configuration offers the option to select the Thread Device Role, with<br /> only two choices available in the CLI configuration: FTD and MTD. It is important to<br /> note that RCP is not supported in the CLI. The device role selected in the CLI will<br /> update the device role in the Thread stack configuration, which will then populate the<br /> device role-specific configurations in the Thread Stack Configuration options. By<br /> default, the device role in the CLI is set to FTD.

The image below illustrates the CLI configuration based on the selected device role and<br /> its corresponding options.

**Configuration of CLI and FTD** - The device role selected as FTD in the CLI<br /> configuration corresponds to the device role specified in the thread stack<br /> configuration, as shown in the image below. There are no limitations in FTD<br /> configuration when CLI services are included.

**Configuration of CLI and MTD** - The device role selected as MTD in the CLI<br /> configuration corresponds to the device role specified in the thread stack<br /> configuration, as shown in the image below. The option to enable Sleep mode cannot be<br /> selected while CLI services are in use.
