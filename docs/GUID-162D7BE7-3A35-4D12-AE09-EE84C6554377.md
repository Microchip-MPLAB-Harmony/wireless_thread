# Introduction

The Thread stack is a reliable and cost-effective open standard for low-power wireless<br /> device-to-device \(D2D\) communication. It is specifically designed for Connected Home<br /> applications that require IP-based networking and support a variety of application<br /> layers on the stack.

**General Characteristics of Thread:**

The following are the typical features of the Thread stack and network:

-   **Simple network installation, start up and operation:**Simple protocol for forming, joining, and maintaining Thread Networks allow systems to self-configure and fix routing problems as they occur.
-   **Secure:** In order to ensure the security of the Thread Network, devices are only allowed to join if they have been authorized and all communications are encrypted and secure.
-   **Small and large networks:** Home networks can range from a few devices to hundreds of devices that communicate with each other seamlessly. The network layer is specifically designed to enhance the network's performance based on the intended usage.
-   **Range:**Typical devices in conjunction with mesh networking provide sufficient range to cover a normal home. Spread spectrum technology is used at the physical layer to provide good immunity to interference.
-   **No single point of failure:** The stack is designed to provide secure and reliable operations even with the failure or loss of individual devices.
-   **Low power:** Host devices can typically operate for several years on AA type batteries using suitable duty cycles.

**Architecture of Thread Stack:**

The Thread stack architecture is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard and is designed to<br /> support IPv6 networking. It is composed of various layers, including the physical, MAC,<br /> network, transport, and application layers. Each layer has a specific function that is<br /> essential for the Thread network's operation. The physical layer is responsible for<br /> transmitting and receiving data wirelessly. The MAC layer manages data transmission<br /> between devices and provides access to the wireless medium. The network layer routes<br /> data between devices in the network. The transport layer ensures reliable data delivery<br /> and error correction. Finally, the application layer serves as the interface between the<br /> Thread network and the device's application.

**Microchip Thread SDK Overview:**

The Microchip SDK for Thread offers support through MPLAB Code Configurator\(MCC\)<br /> component, a user-friendly GUI tool that simplifies configuration and generates code<br /> based on the selected Thread configuration. The purpose of this software development kit<br /> \(SDK\) is to provide support for system-on-chip \(SOC\) and radio co-processor \(RCP\)<br /> designs. Additionally, it includes Mbed TLS handling, which is an implementation of the<br /> TLS and SSL protocols that enables open thread operation with the necessary<br /> cryptographic algorithms required by the open thread. This SDK also offers a thread<br /> command line interface \(CLI\) application as a separate MPLAB Code Configurator<br /> component, which is available for system-on-chip designs.

More details about the Microchip Thread SDK can be found in the upcoming sections.
