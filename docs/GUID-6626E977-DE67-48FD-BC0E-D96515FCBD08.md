# CLI Component MCC Overview

The Thread CLI MCC Component is responsible for managing the command line interface<br /> parsing services offered by the legacy open thread. The CLI Component in MPLAB Code<br /> Configurator is dependent on the Thread Stack MCC component, which is activated when the<br /> CLI services are included. The CLI utilizes the Thread USART service to parse incoming<br /> CLI commands, output responses, and manage Thread log output. The Thread CLI<br /> automatically activates the Thread USART dependency.
